# 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Guide

This guide provides the **exact settings** needed to deploy this application on Hostinger's Node.js Hosting.

## 🛠️ Hostinger Node.js Selector Settings

When setting up your application in the Hostinger Panel, use these values:

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Application Root** | `/public_html` (or your chosen project folder) |
| **Application URL** | `yourdomain.com` |
| **Application Startup File** | `backend/index.js` |
| **Environment** | `Production` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since we use a nested structure, Hostinger needs to know that the code to run is in `backend/dist/index.js`.

## 📂 Project Structure on Server
Ensure your files are uploaded as follows:
```
/root (e.g. public_html)
  ├── .env                   <-- Paste your variables here
  ├── backend/
  │    ├── dist/             <-- Generated by build
  │    ├── package.json
  │    └── prisma/
  ├── dashboard/
  │    └── dist/             <-- Generated by build
  └── public-verifier/
       └── dist/             <-- Generated by build
```

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Build Frontends Locally
Hostinger's RAM is often limited. Build everything on your computer first:

1. Open a terminal in the project root.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run build:full
   ```
   *This command now builds everything (Dashboard, Verifier, and Backend).*

### 2. Upload Files
Upload the entire project structure as shown above using FTP or File Manager.

### 3. Configure `.env`
Create a `.env` file at the **Project Root** (outside the `backend` folder). 
The backend is now programmed to search for it automatically!

```env
JWT_SECRET="your_secret"
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

### 4. Install & Run on Hostinger
1. In the Node.js Selector, click **Run NPM Install**.
   - *This will automatically trigger `npm run build` which now includes `prisma generate`.*
2. Click **Start App**.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
- **App won't start?** Make sure the **Application Startup File** is set to `backend/dist/index.js`.
- **Database errors?** Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` uses the correct external address if Supabase/Cloud DB is used.
- **Port issue?** Hostinger usually manages the port, but our app defaults to `process.env.PORT` which is fine.
